### Purpose
- The purpose of this website is to mainly demonstrate my skills as a frontend developer using React, Javascript and SASS.
- As a website it serves to allow users to easily find recipes that they can cook at home, find pictures of these recipes and the chef who makes it.

### Cool Features
- Use of SASS animations for a modern website feel
- Settings page allowing users to select light or dark theme
- Users can select a primary colour theme
- Font size is adjustable to small 16px, medium 20px or large 24px
- Animation speed is also adjustable to preferrence in the settings page.

  #### Future sprint Plans
- Future features will be implemented where many more recipes are brought in via API and then these recipes can be filtered through in the recipes page.
- User authentication which will allow users to save recipes for later.
