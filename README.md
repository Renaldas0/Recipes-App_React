# Recipes-App_React

## Find the Website [Here](https://renaldas0.github.io/Recipes-App_React/)

### Purpose
- The purpose of this website is to mainly demonstrate my skills as a frontend developer using React, Javascript and SASS.
- As a website it serves to allow users to easily find recipes that they can cook at home, find pictures of these recipes and the chef who makes it.

  #### Future sprint Plans
- Future features will be implemented where many more recipes are brought in via API and then these recipes can be filtered through in the recipes page.
- User authentication which will allow users to save recipes for later.
